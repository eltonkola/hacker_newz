how can i learn flutter? by making an app!

## About

This project playground for me, to experiment and play with flutter.

This app is inspired on https://github.com/hidroh/materialistic, but in flutter. The goal is not to clone that app, or its features, just a visual reference.

The app will be a real success i can replace my personal use of materialistic with this app

## Api

This app is using the official hn api.
